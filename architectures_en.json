The name Rēgistan (ریگستان) means \"sandy place\" or \"desert\" in Persian.\n\nThe Registan was a public square, where people gathered to hear royal proclamations, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes called dzharchis - and a place of public executions. It is framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Islamic architecture. The square was regarded as the hub of the Timurid Renaissance.",

The opening of the monument, attended by President Islam Karimov, was timed to coincide with the celebration of the second anniversary of the country's independence.\n\nThe sculpture depicts Tamerlane sitting astride a horse in full marching attire, wearing a helmet made in the form of a royal crown, with a saber in a scabbard on his belt, which was a distinctive feature of the military class of that era and with a shield strapped to the saddle. The commander holds the reins of the horse with his left hand, the right hand is raised up. The name of the ruler \"AMIR TEMUR\" and his motto \"power in justice\" are engraved on the pedestal of the monument in four languages — Uzbek, Russian, English and Arabic.",
